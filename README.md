# No-Churn-Telecom

### Predicting Customer Churn for a Telecom Company using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by telecom companies. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to churn (leave the service).  

By identifying at-risk customers early, the business can take proactive steps to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze telecom customer data to identify churn patterns  
- Build and evaluate predictive models for churn detection  
- Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies  

## 🧩 Dataset

- **Source:** Public Telecom Churn Dataset (e.g., Kaggle)  
- **Type:** Tabular dataset with demographic, usage, and subscription data  
- **Key Columns:**
  - `customerID`
  - `gender`
  - `tenure`
  - `MonthlyCharges`
  - `TotalCharges`
  - `Contract`
  - `Churn` (Target Variable)

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Imported dataset and explored key features  
   - Checked data types, null values, and statistical summary  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and categorical encoding  
   - Normalized numerical columns  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn distribution and customer patterns  
   - Identified correlations between features and churn rate  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Applied ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for performance improvement  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Used metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

6. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Highlighted key factors contributing to churn  
   - Suggested data-driven retention strategies

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **high monthly charges** show higher churn rates.  
- Long-term customers with **two-year contracts** are more loyal.  
- **Electronic check payments** are more common among churned users.  

---

## 🚀 Results

- Best Model: **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Accuracy: ~85% (depending on tuning and data splits)  
- Key Outcome: Improved ability to target at-risk customers effectively

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data science process — from data preprocessing and visualization to model building and business insight generation.  
It serves as a solid foundation for real-world churn prediction systems used in telecom analytics and customer relationship management (CRM).
